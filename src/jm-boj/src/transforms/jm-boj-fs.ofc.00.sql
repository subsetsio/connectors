-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified
-- pure casts only, no data fixes. Regenerate after model-verify;
-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: The `series` values are other-financial-corporation summary line items; distinguish components from totals before aggregating.
