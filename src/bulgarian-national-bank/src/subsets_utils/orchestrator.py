"""DAG orchestration with run-state persistence.

The DAG class:
- Runs each NodeSpec in dependency order (topological sort), each in a fresh
  forked subprocess (memory isolation per node). A node with no deps is ready
  immediately; nodes with deps wait until every dependency has completed
  successfully. Ties (independent nodes) keep declaration order.
- Runs each node in a fresh forked subprocess (memory isolation per node)
- Writes run.json after each node
- Marks status as "needs_continuation" if any node returns True (pagination)
- Knows nothing about exit codes or time budgets — that's runner.py's job.

Subprocess-per-node:
- Each node is executed in a forked child process via multiprocessing.
- Child runs one fn(id), pipes back a result dict, exits. OS reclaims RSS.
- One node OOMing only kills that node; the rest of the DAG continues.
- Tracking state (asset_writers, io_records) is serialized by the child and
  merged into the supervisor's tracking module after each node completes.

Continuation pattern:
- A node returns True to signal "more work to do, please retrigger me later"
- The orchestrator records this in run.json status field
- Runner.py reads run.json after subprocess exit and translates the status
  to an exit code (0=done or done_with_failures, 2=continuation, 1=failed)
- Node failures never kill the continuation chain: in continue mode a failed
  node is quarantined per-spec (it and its transitive dependents are marked
  failed) and, when the time budget expires with work still pending, the run
  still hands off as needs_continuation. Only a run that concluded with no
  successes — or was told to crash — finalizes as failed. A concluded run
  with some specs done and some failed reports done_with_failures.
- A SIGTERM that interrupts the supervisor does NOT trigger continuation —
  the run is marked failed, and a human must investigate. Auto-retrigger
  on host kill would loop forever on a real OOM root cause.

Each main.py invocation is a fresh DAG run. Per-asset idempotency is the
fetch fn's responsibility (raw_asset_exists + state). Cross-invocation
inheritance of node statuses was removed — it caused log/run.json to claim
nodes ran in this invocation when they hadn't, and the harness's on-disk
probe disagreed with the orchestrator about where to find raw.

            targets: Optional list of spec kinds OR spec ids to run.

        Env vars:
            DAG_TARGET: Comma-separated target tokens. Each token matches against
              spec.kind first, falling back to exact spec.id match.
            DAG_ON_FAILURE: "crash" (default) or "continue".
            DAG_PARALLELISM: Max concurrent nodes (default 1 = sequential).
            DAG_DRAIN_TIMEOUT_S: Max seconds to wait for children on SIGTERM (default 8).
            DAG_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES: In continue mode, halt scheduling after
              this many consecutive node failures (default 10). Resets on any
              success. Guards against thrashing when an entire run is broken
              (auth dead, R2 down, etc.). Ignored in crash mode.

        Behavior:
            - Each node runs in a fresh forked child; OS reclaims RSS on exit.
            - A node OOM (SIGKILL) only fails that node; the rest of the DAG
              continues unless DAG_ON_FAILURE=crash.
            - On a node returning True: marks needs_continuation, continues running.
            - On node failure with crash mode: drains in-flight tasks, then raises.
            - On node failure with continue mode: the failure is quarantined —
              recorded per-spec (its transitive dependents are marked failed as
              skipped_blocked) while unrelated nodes keep running. A failure
              never suppresses a continuation hand-off: if the time budget
              expires (or a node requested continuation) with work still
              pending, run.json finalizes as needs_continuation so the chain
              retriggers; the next invocation retries failed specs fresh.
              run() only raises when the run as a whole is failed — see the
              decision logic at the end of this method and _overall_status().
            - On reaching DAG_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES: scheduling halts. If at
              least one node ran to done this invocation the halt hands off as
              needs_continuation (localized breakage must not orphan pending
              work); with zero progress it finalizes as failed — retriggering
              a systemically broken run would loop forever.
            - On SIGTERM: drains in-flight, marks remaining as failed, writes
              run.json with status="failed". No auto-retrigger from host kill.
            - The DAG class never calls sys.exit() — exit codes are runner.py's job.
