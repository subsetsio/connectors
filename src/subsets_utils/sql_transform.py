"""Runtime executor for SqlNodeSpec: raw asset(s) in → SQL → one Delta table.

The orchestrator routes SqlNodeSpec nodes here instead of calling a
connector-authored fn. `run_sql_node` is a top-level function so it survives
spawn-context pickling; the spec instance itself (id, deps, sql) is the only
payload.

Per dep, raw files are discovered by globbing the run-scoped raw dir
(`<dep>.<ext>` first, falling back to the batch layout `<dep>-*`), mapped to
the matching DuckDB reader by extension, and registered as a temp view named
after the dep id. The connector's SQL then runs against those views and the
result streams into `overwrite(<table>)`. Zero rows is a failure: the
transform is the correctness gate on raw, and an empty publish means the raw
shape or the SQL is wrong.
