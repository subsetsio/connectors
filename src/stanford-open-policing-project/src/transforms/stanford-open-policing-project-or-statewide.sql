-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified
-- pure casts only, no data fixes. Regenerate after model-verify;
-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: Stop-level records for a single published jurisdiction; available fields, raw_* columns, and local coding systems vary by jurisdiction, so compare like columns carefully across tables.
