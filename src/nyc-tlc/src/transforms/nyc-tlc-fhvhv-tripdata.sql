-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified
-- pure casts only, no data fixes. Regenerate after model-verify;
-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: Rows are reported high-volume FHV trip events without a stable trip identifier; repeated request, pickup, and dropoff timestamps can occur for distinct trips.
