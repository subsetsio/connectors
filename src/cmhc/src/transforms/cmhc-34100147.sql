-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified
-- pure casts only, no data fixes. Regenerate after model-verify;
-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: the `geo` column mixes aggregation levels: national, provincial and roll-up rows (e.g. Canada, the provinces, 'Census metropolitan areas', 'All census agglomerations 50,000 and over') appear as ordinary rows alongside individual centres — filter `geo` before summing.
-- caution: `type_of_unit` mixes subtotals with their components — 'Total units' overlap the component categories ('All other types of units', 'Single-detached units'); summing across the column double-counts. Pick one level.
-- caution: every row of this table is suppressed for confidentiality (`status` = 'x') — the source publishes the series skeleton (geography x type of unit x month) but no observations at all. `value` is null throughout. The table carries no measurements.
