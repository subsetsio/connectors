-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified
-- pure casts only, no data fixes. Regenerate after model-verify;
-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: the `geo` column mixes aggregation levels: national, provincial and roll-up rows (e.g. Canada, the provinces, 'Census metropolitan areas', 'All census agglomerations 50,000 and over') appear as ordinary rows alongside individual centres — filter `geo` before summing.
-- caution: `value` is expressed in thousands of units (the source's SCALAR_FACTOR)  not in single units — multiply by 1 000 for absolute figures.
