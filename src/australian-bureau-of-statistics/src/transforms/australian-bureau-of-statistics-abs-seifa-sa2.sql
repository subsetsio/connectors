-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified

-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: ABS SDMX dataflows may include totals and component categories in the same coded dimensions; filter dimensions deliberately before aggregating observations.
