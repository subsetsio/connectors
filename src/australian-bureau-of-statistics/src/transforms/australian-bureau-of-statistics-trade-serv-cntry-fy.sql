-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified
-- pure casts only, no data fixes. Regenerate after model-verify;
-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: ABS SDMX dataflows may include totals and component categories in the same coded dimensions; filter dimensions deliberately before aggregating observations.
-- caution: The model verifier did not nominate a compact key for this wide cross-tabulation; treat rows as source observations unless a later model pass asserts the full dimension key.
