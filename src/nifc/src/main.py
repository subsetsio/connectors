"""National Interagency Fire Center connector — discovers *_SPECS in src/nodes/ and runs the DAG.

load_nodes() picks up two kinds of specs from the node modules:
  - NodeSpec     → executed as DAG nodes (the fetches)
  - MaintainSpec → freshness checks; evaluated pre-spawn. A MaintainSpec
                   whose check() returns True marks its NodeSpec done so
                   downstream specs proceed without re-fetching.

Result: a fresh-everywhere connector exits without spawning any fetch
subprocesses. A stale connector only spawns the stale specs.

Authoring order is download → maintain. Before maintain has run, there are
no MaintainSpecs and every NodeSpec executes. That's the right default for
the first crawl.
