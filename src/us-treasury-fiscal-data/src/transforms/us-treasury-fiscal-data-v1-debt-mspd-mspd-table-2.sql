-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified
-- pure casts only, no data fixes. Regenerate after model-verify;
-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: Aggregate rows sit alongside the components they sum: `debt_limit_class1_desc` ('Total Debt Subject to Limit', 'Total Public Debt Outstanding', 'Total Public Debt Subject to Limit', …). Summing an amount column without excluding them double-counts.
