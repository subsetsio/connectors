-- compiled by `hardened compile-transforms` from the measured model
-- profiles (model/tables + columns). Faithful pass-through: verified
-- pure casts only, no data fixes. Regenerate after model-verify;
-- durable edits belong in the model stage, not here.
-- caution: Rows combine annual and quarterly observations; use `frequency` to avoid mixing time granularities.
-- caution: FDI component rows and balances appear together; select `indicator_en` before aggregation.
